            <p>Recognizing that some students who are feeling isolated, depressed, or anxious may find it challenging to connect with our resources and verbally express their needs, Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is pleased to announce the piloting of <a href="https://caps.umich.edu/article/togetherall">Togetherall</a>, an online, anonymous peer-support tool available for free to our students.</p>
